        <h1>The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie</h1>
        <img src="../images/sugar_cookie.jpeg">
        <p>Whenever you make these cookies for someone,
         be sure to bring along several copies of the
         recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise! 
         NOTE: I make icing with confectioners' sugar 
         and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I 'paint' 
         the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. 
         Thin enough to spread easily but not so thin 
         that it just makes your cookies wet and runs 
         off. </p>

                    Cream together butter and sugar until
                    until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla.
                    Stir flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover,
                    and chill dough for at least one hour
                    (or overnight).

                    Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees)
                    C. Roll out dough on floured surface 1/4 to
                    1/2 inch thick. Cut into shapes with any cookie
                    cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart on ungreased
                    cookie sheats.
